Automatic router reset when it hangs up or there is no internet in your home.

See the video about it on Youtube: https://youtu.be/boMHq9PBy9M

FREE SOURCE CODE!!! I will show you how to make a cheap smart switch in Arduino. It will automatically do a router reset when it hangs up or there is no internet in your home. It does not matter which router it resets: Netgear, Linksys, Asus... No more questions how to reset router, how to reboot router... I will use ESP8266 and Arduino. More specific - Sonoff S20 smart switch, a wifi smart plug, but you can use Nodemcu or other ESP8266 or even ESP32 module. Free code, sources for Arduino on my GitHub page. A simple DIY project and a cheap wifi solution with a smart switch.
ESP8266 programmed in Arduino will check for your wifi internet accessibility and where there is none after a certain time, it will reset router or any device you connect to it. The Sonoff S20 has a button which we will use for manual reset.
